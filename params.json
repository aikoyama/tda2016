  "body": "### Welcome to the First International Workshop on Technical Debt Analytics\r\nAn open challenge in Technical Debt (TD) research is to translate TD threats into economic opportunities, so development teams can make a strong case to the business side to invest on paying off TD by increasing Technical Wealth (TW). For this, a comprehensive TD/TW theory (e.g., standardizing ambiguous terms into a consistent vocabulary) is needed to formalize and consolidate relationships between the cost of TD and benefit of TW. We aim to gather practitioners and researchers working in this area, to share experiences, concur on terminologies and evaluation guidelines. Participants are invited to submit a position paper of 2-4 pages or an abstract for a lightning talk on the following topics:\r\n\r\n* Frameworks/Methodologies to compare/synthesize TD/TW empirical studies \r\n* Moderator factors of TD/TW empirical studies\r\n* Frameworks for comparing TD detection and TW improvement approaches and tools  \r\n* Conceptual and technical differences between TD/TW approaches  \r\n* Cross-comparison of terminologies used in TD/TW body of knowledge\r\n* Social debt-related (social/organisational shortcomings) factors affecting TD/TW\r\n\r\n### Submission guidelines:\r\nParticipants are invited to submit a position paper of 2-4 pages or an abstract for a lightning talk on the workshop topics. All submissions will be peer-reviewed and judged on the basis of their clarity, relevance, and interest to the workshop participants. At least one author of each accepted paper has to register for the workshop. Paper submissions must be in English and conform to the IEEE Double Column format:\r\nhttp://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html\r\n\r\nPapers are to be submitted electronically to the TDA EasyChair paper submission system\r\n(https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tda2016)\r\n\r\nThe workshop proceedings will be published at CEUR-WS, which is indexed by dblp.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates:\r\n- Paper submission:\t\tOctober  22, 2016\r\n- Acceptance notification:\tNovember 09, 2016\r\n- Camera-ready version:\t\tNovember 19, 2016\r\n- Workshop:\t\t\tDecember 06, 2016\r\n\r\n### Organizers:\r\n- Aiko Yamashita (CWI, Netherlands & Oslo and Akershus University College, Norway)\r\n- Leon Moonen (Simula Research Laboratory, Norway)\r\n- Tom Mens (University of Mons, Belgium)\r\n- Amjed Tahir (Massey University, New Zealand)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can contact us for questions, commends and feedback at: tda2016@googlegroups.com",
